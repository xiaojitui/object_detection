This is the YOLO_v3 model to detect table areas. 

This is developed based on: https://github.com/YunYang1994/tensorflow-yolov3
Please go to the link, read for more information, and git clone. 

To train and test your own dataset, follow the instruction: 
(1) save class names as 'dataset.names' in './data/classes'
(2) save train_data groundtruth and test_data groundtruth as 'train.txt' and 'test.txt' in './data/dataset'. the format is: imgpath, bbox, classid. In this case, classid = 1 (table) or 0 (background)
(3) To train, run: 
python convert_weight.py --train_from_coco
python train.py
(4) To evaluate, run:
python evaluate.py
cd mAP
python main.py -na
